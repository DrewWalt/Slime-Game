Slime Demo Revisited 

The idea behind this project is to revisit the 2D demo we put together but make it better by updating the assets, fine tuning the controls, and learn more about the things we never got to such as UI, music and SFX, etc. 
Some things I would like to address regarding the project are that the overall premise is a vampire survivors like. My personal opinion is that we should return to and finish this project and almost use it as a testing ground/launching off point for a different, more linear style game. 
The premise of the game is simple. There will be a timer, a score, the player, and the slimes. I have no intention to create any other type of enemy. As this is just a demo, there will be no ending, it will just be a ‘get a high score’ game. Almost like an arcade game. I plan for there to be upgrades and a character select. The character select will be like risk of rain. Choose a character, that character has 4 set skills, a (possibly) unique dodge roll, and upgrades specific to them. The upgrades will be very simple like increase move speed, increase damage, etc (up to a max). I also kinda want there to be skill upgrades that change what the characters’ skills do but that's not necessary. For the time being we will just start with one character and I can make more if we want to add more. 

Roadmap
Find all of our old assets that we had as well as our old demo and update the demo with those assets. Or just create a brand new project and import the sprite sheets and code from the old one. 

Pick up where we left off which was trying to get the player to use different attacks in different ways. For example, pressing a button -> applies a targeting circle or arrow -> click to release the attack. Also add a dodge roll mechanic. Just a button press that propels the player forward while giving them i-frames. 
During the programming of this stage and the next, I will work on creating new visuals such as more skills, the main menu, character select screen, and the pause menu, death animations for the player and the enemies, particle effects, and anything else we would like/need.

Once we figure that out, add the UI with the skills in their little boxes and program in a skill cooldown system. During this stage we should also go ahead and add the timer, score, and a health bar.        	
At this point we would have a game. So I think we just step back and polish up anything that maybe we rushed or think could use some touching up.                                                                                   

Add the upgrades and leveling. This will take some brainstorming on how we actually want to implement this, what the values will be, etc. 

Add a character select screen after the main menu.

Add BGM and SFX

Add more characters, skill, mechanics, music, etc as we see fit.









Beyond ideas
This is about a possible way to expand upon the slime game revised when/if we complete the roadmap. 
The premise of the game draws a lot of inspiration from the anime "i've been killing slimes for 300 years" so i'm thinking we could draw even more inspiration off of it and make it kind of like moonlighter. 
Just as a refresher, from what I remember, moonlighters gameplay loop is that you go to a dungeon, kill enemies, collect their loot, sell their loot at your store, repeat. 
so what i'm thinking is that there are 3 separate zones: the infinite scrolling slime fields/wild area, a player home, and a small town. 
you could even just make them all connected through loading screens like in stoneshard. see MS paint diagram 

turning the game into something like this would introduce more mechanics and more enjoyable loop due to having something to work towards. 
it would also effectively change the genre of the game into something more akin to a campaign style game where once you have everything you're done. Death is not the end. 
about 'having everything', if the game were set up like this, the money you get from selling the slime's magic stones in town would have to have something to be exchanged for. For this we would have to introduce equipment and other things the player can spend their money on. 
At the same time, for there to be a reason for the house to exist, there would have to be stuff to do in the house. my immediate thought is that you could decorate it with stuff you can buy in the town. there could be a day night cycle that forces the character to sleep like in stardew valley to maintain and enforce the routine of the gameplay loop. 
I think there are a lot of possibilities with this idea such as a leveling system with rpg mechanics (think stat point allocation), cooking for food buffs, town npc affection system (affection is not the right word but like when you build up respect with certain npcs so they give you discounts and gifts and stuff when you talk to them), day night cycles give way to having the ability to schedule events on certain days in the town or in the wild area (bosses or holidays). 
If we finish the game and want to continue adding to it we can think more about this idea as a group.
